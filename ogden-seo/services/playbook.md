# 🛠 Ogden Construction — Services Page Playbook (SEO + Structure + Conversion)

Purpose:  
Transform the Services page into a clear, persuasive hub that showcases core specialties — with decks as primary — while still presenting Ogden Construction as a capable licensed general contractor for foothill + Tahoe homeowners.

Audience:  
Homeowners in Placerville, South Lake Tahoe, El Dorado Hills, Folsom, and surrounding foothills seeking outdoor improvements, repairs, or remodels.

## 🎯 1. Strategic Role of the Services Page

The Services page should:
✔ clarify what Ogden offers  
✔ differentiate where expertise is strongest (decks)  
✔ support SEO across sub-services  
✔ feed location pages + portfolio pages  
✔ funnel users to quotes/consults  
✔ avoid overwhelming users with options

The structure should be **hub → spoke**, where the hub is Services and spoke pages include:

- Decks (Primary)
- Outdoor Living
- Repairs & Dry Rot
- Pergolas / Patio Structures
- Remodels
- General Construction

---

## 🧩 2. Content Components (Required)

Minimum sections to include:

1. **Decks (Primary Speciality + Explanation)**
2. **Outdoor Living & Structures**
3. **Repairs & Dry Rot**
4. **Remodels**
5. **General Contracting / Construction**
6. **Service Areas (Optional List)**
7. **Process + Timeline (Short)**
8. **Materials (Short)**
9. **CTA (Quote / Consult)**
10. **Internal Links (Portfolio, Locations, FAQs)**

---

## 🧱 3. Recommended Service Hierarchy (Very Important)

Hierarchy should reflect real demand + profitability:

**Tier 1 (Flagship):**

- Deck Construction (Deck Building, Deck Replacement, Deck Rebuilds)
  Focus on:
  ✔ Trex / Composite
  ✔ Redwood
  ✔ Tahoe builds (snow load, elevation)
  ✔ Placerville builds (hillside, dry rot)

**Tier 2 (Outdoor Living):**

- Pergolas
- Patio Covers
- Railings
- Stairs
- Fencing
- Backyard structures

**Tier 3 (Repair + Maintenance):**

- Dry rot repair
- Structural repair
- Deck resurfacing
- Rebuilds
- Code upgrades

**Tier 4 (Remodel + Construction):**

- Remodels
- Additions
- General GC work

This order communicates:
→ “Deck specialist”  
→ “Full GC when needed”

Without diluting brand.

## 📍 4. Local SEO Support (Subtle, Not Spammy)

Services page should support geography lightly:

Recommended mentions:

- Placerville
- Tahoe
- El Dorado County
- Foothills
- Northern California

No need for keyword blocks — location pages already handle that.

- Pergolas & Patio Covers

- Dry Rot Repair
- Remodels / Additions

These can interlink with location pages for ranking compounding.
