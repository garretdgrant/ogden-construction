# 📸 Ogden Construction — Portfolio Page Playbook (SEO + Conversion)

Purpose:  
Turn the portfolio page into a high-trust, high-conversion sales asset that supports deck-first positioning, enhances local SEO, and answers pre-purchase objections visually (materials, quality, climate, cost, timeline, permitting).

Applies to:  
/portfolio  
and future project detail pages if created.

## 🎯 1. Strategic Role of the Portfolio Page

Portfolio serves:

1. Conversion (primary)
2. SEO (secondary)
3. Authority / Social Proof (supporting)

---

## 🧩 2. Content Components (Required)

Each project card/block should ideally include:

- Project title (human + helpful)
- City or region (local SEO signal)
- Material used (Trex, Redwood, Composite)
- Service type (deck, repair, pergola, etc.)
- Visual assets (before / after / in-progress)
- CTA (estimate, consult, quote)

Minimum acceptable:
Image + City + Service

Ideal:
Image + City + Material + Service + CTA

---

## 📍 3. Local SEO Considerations

Portfolio should reinforce:

- Deck specialty
- Service regions (e.g., Tahoe, Placerville)
- Material expertise
- Climate considerations

Examples:
“Composite Deck — South Lake Tahoe”
“Redwood Deck Repair — Placerville”
“Outdoor Living Remodel — Folsom”

Avoid generic naming (“Deck Project”)

---

## 💰 4. Pricing / Timeline Transparency (Optional but Strong)

Pricing bands (suggested):
Entry: $8k–$15k  
Mid-Range: $15k–$35k  
Premium: $35k–$80k+

Timeline:
2–6 weeks typical deck project duration.

These dramatically increase conversion.

---

## ❄️ 5. Climate / Material Notes (High Value)

Examples by region:
Tahoe → snow load, moisture, composite durability, permitting, elevation  
Placerville → redwood popularity, hillside builds, dry rot repair  
Folsom → HOA considerations, aesthetic upgrades

These build trust + niche authority.

---

## 🔗 6. Internal Linking Strategy

Portfolio should link to:

- Location pages
- FAQ page
- Materials/pricing guides
- Contact/quote form

Avoid external links (leaks attention & authority)

Internal linking benefits:
✔ crawl depth  
✔ relevance  
✔ conversions  
✔ dwell time

---

## 📂 7. Optional: Individual Project Detail Pages

If created later, each can target:

- city + service
- material + climate
- before/after transformations
- problem → solution framing

Expands SEO + conversion power.

---

## 🧱 8. Layout Structure (Recommended)

Portfolio Page Structure:

1. Hero  
   “Recent Projects” + deck-forward messaging

2. Filters (optional)

   - Material
   - City
   - Project Type

3. Project Grid/List  
   Uniform cards (3–4 per row)

4. CTA Bottom  
   “Planning a Spring Deck Project?”  
   “Request an Estimate”

---

## ⭐ 9. Social Proof Enhancements

Optional but beneficial:

- Testimonials
- References
- Review excerpts
- “20+ years trades experience” badge
- Licensing/insurance signals

---

## 🔍 10. Image Optimization Rules

Ideal:

- Compressed WebP
- Descriptive file names (not IMG_1234.jpg)
- Useful alt tags

Example alt text:
“Composite deck in South Lake Tahoe with railing”
“Redwood hillside deck in Placerville”

Avoid keyword stuffing.

---

## 📈 11. Conversion Considerations

Portfolio should help answer:
✔ Can they do this job?  
✔ In my city?  
✔ With my material?  
✔ Within my climate/conditions?  
✔ What does it cost?  
✔ What does finished work look like?  
✔ How long does it take?

If yes → user requests quote.

---

## 🗄 12. Schema for Portfolio (Optional)

Schema candidates:

- ImageObject (portfolio images)
- Product or Service (if pricing included)
- BreadcrumbList (portfolio → project)
- LocalBusiness (site-wide, not duplicated)

---

- [ ] Deck-first positioning clear
- [ ] City + Material visible on projects
- [ ] Climate notes included (Tahoe)
