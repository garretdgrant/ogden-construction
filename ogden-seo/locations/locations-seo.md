# 📍 Location Page SEO Playbook (Ogden Construction — 2025)

Purpose:
Provide a reusable framework for high-intent, city-specific pages such as:

- /locations-we-serve/south-lake-tahoe-deck-builder-construction
- /locations-we-serve/placerville-deck-builder
- /locations-we-serve/folsom-deck-builder
- etc.

These pages should rank for “{city} deck builder” + related variants and convert visitors into quote requests or consults.

This playbook is an **add-on** to the main site SEO playbook and should not duplicate global rules unless relevant to location pages.

---

## 🎯 1. SEO Objective for Location Pages

Goal:
Dominate local-intent searches, such as:

- “South Lake Tahoe deck builder”
- “Placerville deck contractor”
- “Composite decks Tahoe”
- “Deck repair Placerville”
- “Pergola builder El Dorado County”

These searches indicate immediate or near-term purchase intent.

Priority = **Decks first**, GC services second.

---

## 🌍 2. Location Page Structure Overview

Each location page should contain:

1. **H1: City + Service intent**
   Example: “South Lake Tahoe Deck Builder & Outdoor Construction”

2. **Local Proof**
   (why this service in this location matters)

3. **Materials + Climate Considerations**
   (very strong for Tahoe / snow / elevation markets)

4. **Pricing Expectations**
   (optional ranges)

5. **Portfolio References**
   (include specific city if possible)

6. **Service Coverage**
   (GC services as secondary)

7. **Testimonials / Reputation signals**
   (even general reputation helps)

8. **FAQ Section (City-specific)**

9. **CTA Section**
   (Quote, Consult, Call, Schedule)

10. **Internal Links**
    (Portfolio, FAQ, Pricing, Nearby cities)

11. **JSON-LD**
    (Breadcrumb + FAQ + LocalBusiness)

## 🧱 3. Required Content Components (Location Pages)

### **A. Local Relevance Block (VERY IMPORTANT)**

Explain why building in that location has unique considerations:

Examples:

✔ Tahoe → snow load, moisture, fire zones, composite performance, elevation  
✔ Placerville → hillside lots, dry rot, redwood availability, property lines  
✔ Folsom → HOA compliance, outdoor living, aesthetic-driven upgrades

This block drives:

- E-E-A-T
- dwell time
- local relevance
- conversion confidence

### **B. Deck as Primary Service**

Brief overview of deck builds:

- materials
- durability
- maintenance
- timeline
- permitting
- GC capabilities

### **C. GC Services as Secondary**

Soft mention:

- remodels
- dry rot
- pergolas
- fencing
  etc.

Do not overshadow decks.

### **D. Pricing Expectations Block**

Three tiers work best:

Entry Projects: $8k–$15k
Mid-Range: $15k–$35k
Premium/Luxury: $35k–$80k+

markdown
Copy code

Tailor to location (Tahoe skews premium).

### **E. City-Specific FAQs**

See section 6.

### **F. Trust Signals**

Recommended options:

- founded date
- 20+ years trades experience
- license/insured
- references available
- portfolio link

### **G. CTA**

Strong & simple:

- Free estimate
- Schedule consult
- Request quote

Prefer 2 CTAs per page:

- top (conversion)
- bottom (end-of-scroll)

---

## 🌐 4. URL / Slug Strategy

Slug format:

/locations-we-serve/{city}-deck-builder-construction

yaml
Copy code

This supports:

- deck intent
- geo intent
- GC expansion
- future indexing for “{city} construction”

---

## 🏷 5. Metadata & SERP Strategy (Location Pages)

### **Title Tag**

Formula:
{City} Deck Builder | Composite, Redwood & Outdoor Construction | Ogden Construction

yaml
Copy code

### **Meta Description**

Include:
✔ city
✔ specialty (decks)
✔ materials
✔ CTA

Example:
“Custom decks in South Lake Tahoe built for snow and elevation. Composite, Trex and redwood builds. Free estimates. Licensed & insured general contractor serving Tahoe.”

---

## 🧩 6. FAQ Strategy (Location Pages)

Each city should include 4–8 FAQs covering:

✔ materials  
✔ climate  
✔ permits  
✔ pricing  
✔ GC capabilities  
✔ timeline

### **Examples (Tahoe)**

- “What decking materials perform best in Tahoe snow?”
- “Do Tahoe decks require different structural supports?”
- “How much does a deck cost in South Lake Tahoe?”
- “Do you handle permits in Tahoe?”
- “Do you build composite decks?”
- “Do you offer remodels or repairs in Tahoe?”

### **Examples (Placerville)**

- “Do you build hillside decks?”
- “What materials hold up best in Placerville?”
- “Can you repair dry rot in deck framing?”
- “What is the typical deck cost in Placerville?”
- “Do you offer pergolas and patio structures?”

---

## 🔗 7. Internal Linking Strategy (Location Pages)

Every location page should link to:

Outbound (internal):

- Portfolio
- FAQ page
- Materials/pricing guides
- Neighboring city pages
- Contact/quote

Inbound (internal):

- Location hub page (locations-we-serve)

Link anchors:

- “Deck builder in {city}”
- “Outdoor construction in {city}”
- “See our portfolio”
- “Request a quote”

Do **NOT**:

- keyword stuff
- repeat anchors excessively

---

## 🏗 8. Local E-E-A-T Enhancers

Optional but strong:

✔ photo galleries tagged to city  
✔ mentions of neighborhoods or areas  
✔ climate considerations  
✔ seasonal build guidance  
✔ permit info  
✔ materials discussion  
✔ testimonials from nearby cities

These help rank + convert.

---

## 🧰 9. Schema for Location Pages

Must include:

- BreadcrumbList
- FAQPage
- LocalBusiness (reused, not duplicated with conflicting NAP)

Optional:

- Service
- AreaServed
- ImageObject (portfolio)

---

## 📸 10. Portfolio Integration Rules

If no city-specific portfolio:

- show general builds
- emphasize relevant materials

If city-specific:

- mention city in caption
- include before/after if possible

---

## 📝 Notes for Scaling

When adding multiple cities:

- reuse framework
- do not duplicate copy
- vary materials/pricing/permit differences
- keep human tone for trades audiences

Cities can be grouped by:

- mountain/snow (Tahoe)
- foothill/rural (Placerville)
- suburban (Folsom)
- metro (Sacramento)

This improves relevance + ranking + conversion.
